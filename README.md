# THE POD

A website using the Astronomy Picture of the Day API from NASA.

## TODO

- [x] The site should display the latest picture.
- [x] offers options to see pictures from previous days.
- [x] should also display relative information about the picture.
- [x] pretty layout/design.

- [x] Add next button
- [x] Add a new button on the right side of nav called toggle. It should
toggle the main text area to show relative information about the current picture.
- [x] Add a tittle for the app on the navbar. The Pod is a good name.


- [ ] Check in the response the media type. if is a image display, otherwise ignore
it (for now). sample: https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=XcvfOgftmxfFvTcinvBS1eFJMTo8yhGnrOlG1Ep4&date=2011-7-11

- [ ] Add transition animations. Needs research.

- [x] Host on github and deploy the site using github pages.
- [x] Add deployment automation scripts.

- [ ] Add a license.
- [ ] Re-think makeRequest. it should also consider next(tomorrow)
